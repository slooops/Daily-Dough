## 🤔 The Problem

Ever feel like your money just... _disappears_?

- 💸 "I swear I had more money yesterday"
- 🤷‍♀️ "Can I afford this coffee or not?"
- 📱 "Let me check 3 different apps to figure out my budget"
- 😰 "Did I already spend my fun money this week?"

**Daily Dough fixes this.** One number. Every day. That's it.

## ✨ The Solution

### 🎯 **Your Daily Dial**

See exactly how much discretionary money you have **right now**, displayed as a beautiful daily allowance.

### 🔥 **Streak System**

Build momentum by staying under budget. Watch your streak grow and feel good about your financial discipline.

### 💧 **Slush Fund**

Unspent money rolls into your slush fund – perfect for those bigger purchases or unexpected treats.

### 🏦 **Smart Categorization**

- **Bills** (rent, utilities, subscriptions) – automatically excluded
- **Ignored** (work lunches, medical) – your choice
- **Everything else** – this is your discretionary spending
